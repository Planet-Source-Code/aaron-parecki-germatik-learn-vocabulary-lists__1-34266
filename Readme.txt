Germatik version 3.10 Readme

This is a fully functional program designed to help
in the study of vocabulary lists in German.
I wrote this program originally two years ago in the
text-based GW-BASIC. I was doing poorly on my vocabulary
tests, but after using it, I passed every test with
flying colors.
I started this VB version when I was just learning
Visual Basic, so excuse the sloppiness and/or lack of
comments in some parts.

I do not claim credit for ALL the code used in this
program. I wrote all the structural code, and much
of the code that does the work. But when I encountered
something I had no idea how to do, I turned to PSC for
my answers. Thanks to the many people on PSC whose code I
used. I did modify much of it to suit my needs. If you
see your code, send me your name and I will include it
in the source code if you want. Thanks again.

If you have any suggestions, please email me.

If you modify this program in any way, please send
me your modifications. I am very interesed to see
what people do with this.

I would appreciate if you reported any bugs you may
encounter to me. Feel free to write me!
